# A Quick Paragraph on JavaScript and the "How Computers Work" Video Series

Here are the webpages that were assigned to be read:
- [JavaScript Intro](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Input and Output in JavaScript](https://code-maven.com/input-output-in-plain-javascript)
- [JavaScript Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
- [How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)

So I've just finished the reading notes on JavaScript and, I have to say, that the first reading was a bit confusing. Luckily, I had a bit of context from our 101 course and I could move through the introduction paragraph on history and standards. Basically, JavaScript is a powerful programming what allows your webpage and application to be interactive. 

From the other readings, we see how we can use JavaScript to take in information from the user, using html and the tag `<input>` this tag allows the code to create an input variable that can then be interactive later with the user. When written like this

`<input id="favorite_fruit">`

Essentially, this tag will create an input box that will take in text for a favorite fruit. Using JavaScript, that information can then be input by the user and then assigned to a variable. The code for creating a variable and assigning a value to it would look like this:

`var dogbone = "chewy brand"`

The command `var` is used in JavaScript to create the variable dogbone and that variable has what they call a "string" value (which is just a fancy word for text) and that value is "Chewy Brand". Variables can either have a number or string value... for now.

From the How Computers Work video series, I would say that JavaScript is what makes your webpage more inline with what a computer should do. From these videos, they stated that a computer should be able to take inputted information, store that data, process that data, and then output it. That is exactly what JavaScript allows your webpage to do - interact with the user to input informaiton, do something with it and then output it.

Another cool note about this video series, was the idea that anything could be represented by a number, which means that it can be input into, stored, processed, and then output by a computer. I find that incredibly fascinating, since we are reducing that information down to ones and zeros using the binary system.
