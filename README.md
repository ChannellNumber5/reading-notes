*This is a repository for reading notes for Code Fellows*

Hello! My name is Christina Robinson and this will be my page devoted to **short** introduction and then all of my reading notes for Code Fellows. I'm excited to start down this journey in coding! I hope to continually quote Alice, from *Alice in Wonderland*,  
<'' 'Curiouser and curiouser!'
as I continue in this journey of coding.
