Hello! My name is Christina Robinson and this will be my page devoted to a **short** introduction and then all of my reading notes. I'm excited to start down this journey in coding! I hope to continually quote Alice, from *Alice in Wonderland*,  

> "Curiouser and curiouser!"

on every step of the way, finding new rabbit holes to traverse and coming out of the other side excited to learn more.

## First Up on the "Reading Notes": _GROWTH MINDSET_ 
  as described by Steve Haffenden from Atlassian
  
This was a fantastic listen (with not too long of a length, for all my short attention span people) on how to maintain a dynamic mindset, in a world that's vying for you to settle and plateau. Steve describes the traps that we can fall into, from becoming overwhelmed with the frustrations of our daily tasks or not having enough "Gumption" to complete the tasks we know we ought to, to being envious of coworkers who may be more talented or a quicker learner in certain areas than we are. All of these - and more! - are signs of a lack of a growth mindset - a mindset that is stuck in its ways and resitant to change. Steve does a wonderful job of describing Growth Mindset and then providing key practicals for how to maintain it. For me, here are three reminders for how I keep my self in a growth mindset:

    1. Pay close attention to when I start to lose interest in vital work tasks and start wasting time on idle pursuits
       - This is a sure sign that I've fallen into what is called the "Gumption Trap" wanting to accomplish what's needed, 
       but not quite having the motivation to do it (which is something that I have noticed in myself before). In these 
       situations I need to stop, take a break and then look at my tasks and break them into smaller, more manageable, chunks. 
       After accomplishing a few of these, I've built up enough momentum to cruise through everything on my "To-Do" list.
       
    2. Analyze my frustrations with my coworkers
       - More often than not, this is a sign that I am stuck in a fixed mindset. In those moments I may be finding it hard 
       to relate or understand where they are coming from and, instead of pushing my own agenda or point, I need to stop 
       and put the effort in to see their point and collaborate. 11 times out of 10, it's worth it and leads to a better outcome 
       or solution.
       
    3. Ask myself "Is this really what I want, or is this instant gratification?"
       - The trickiest part of the Growth Mindset for me, is the constant skill of putting off what feels good now, for what 
       is going to best the best in the future. Instead of pushing off the hardest tasks for the end, a Growth Mindset, for me,
       would be to accomplish the most challenging things first and then reward myself with the easier or fun things later.
