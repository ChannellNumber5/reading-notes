*This is a repository for reading notes for Code Fellows*

Hello! My name is Christina Robinson and this will be my page devoted to a **short** introduction and then all of my reading notes for Code Fellows. I'm excited to start down this journey in coding! I hope to continually quote Alice, from *Alice in Wonderland*,  

> "Curiouser and curiouser!"

on every step of the way, finding new rabbit holes to traverse and coming out of the other side excited to learn more.
