# Reading Notes on Text Editors and _**The Terminal**_
---
First off, a Text Editor is *literally* what it sounds like. A program/interface designed to *edit* your text (what a shocker) (:

Well,... maybe that description is a bit too narrow.

A text editor is a program that is used, much like microsoft office, to hold your coding text, as you are working through it.
Like "Microsoft Word" for someone writing a paper, a text editor is used for coders to hold the code that that they are writing. 
And the code is in what we like to call "plain text". It's basic text with no formatting (e.g. bold, italics, underscores, etc.) - kind 
of like text on a typewriter.

Now, to get into the details, a Text Editor is so important because of what it can do for you while you are coding. In the articles that I was reading,
there are key features to look for in a Text Editor, as you start out coding: themes, sytax highlighting, and code completion. Each of these are super 
important because they affect your comfortability with coding in your chosen text editor. Of the three, I think my favorite has to be themes because it deals with 
*COLORS*! Essentially, if your text editor has the option of changing its themes, that means that you are able to change the colors that it displays. 
One theme you've probably dabbled in, if you own any kind of smart phone/tablet, is the "dark" or "night" theme. This changes the backgroung/backdrop of your 
browser/reading app/etc. to be a darker color or a lighter color, without the backlight, depending on the setting. As you know, this is super helpful and a 
SAVER for your eyes. In the same way, for a Text Editor, you are able to change the themes, so that your code is a brighter color or your background is 
darker or lighter depending on how your eyes are feeling.

Now onto --> __*The Terminal*__
Now, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it, but, the Terminal is the background code to what we would call your "file explorer". In plain english, that means
that the Terminal is the background code to the yellow folder that you click on to access your files, funny memes, and cute dog videos. The yellow folder is really
just a facade, so that you - as the user- can simply and beatifully navigate through and create files. While you are doing that, there is a ton of coding being done
in the background. As was mentioned in lecture, the Terminal is used by tech companies to interface with their files located in the cloud, so it's super helpful to 
know how to navigate in the Terminal and not just in your file explorer.

A few basic commmands that you can use to make yourself *dangerous* in the Terminal are:
1. pwd - which stands for "print working directory" - if you ever want to know "where" you are (which, lets be real I ALWAYS want to know where I am especially if 
          it involves being lost in the matrix of coding) use this command and it will let you know your location, in the form of a file path.
          **side note** a path is what you see in your files explorer at the top, to show the location of where you are like C:\Users\CompPerson\Videos\Crazy Cats
1. ls - which is the command to list the different files in the location that you are currently in. Also, you can use the list command to list out the files in
        other locations too, if you specify the location after you type in ls
1. cd - which is the command to Change Directory, which does just that - changes where you are. You can move to your different folders with this command, when you 
        the location path iat the end of the cd command
        
Then, to add in my favorite quote from the reading "everything is a file!" the type of file may change, but as you move around the Terminal, try to think as everything 
being a file. I'm a 3D and visual thinker, so using the Terminal is definitely daunting to me, but thinking of everything as a file, will help me to be able to navigate
through the commands and all of my folders and files.
