We have arrived at studying HTML, which was such a mystery to me for a while. Can I confess that so many times, I've looked at a block of code for a webpage and *quickly* averted my eyes because it just seemed far too daunting to try and figure out.

Turns out **It's not so bad!**

Before I explain more about HTML, let's talk about Wireframing and why it's oh so important to the world of coding and web development. 

## Wireframing

In its most basic form, a Wireframe is like an essay outline. It's the first thoughts and ideas - the foundation, if you will - for your webpage. You'll want to create a Wireframe and organize all of your ideas and thoughts for how you want to your webpage to be organized. *Organization* that is the crucial word for a Wireframe. At its most basic part, a website is just a larger rectangle, broken up into smaller, more stylish rectangles that help convey the information that you want to get across in your webpage.

According to our reading for Wireframes, "The Definitive Guide: How to Make Your First Wireframe", there are three elements that you need to consider:
> 1. What they call "Clarity", essentially, that your user knows the purpose of your website  and can navigate it easily
> 1. What they call "Confidence", that your site is well laid out so that the user knows what to expect and is assured of your legitimacy. This is done by following the norms of how other sites similar to yours are laid out, in order to cater better to the users experience
> 1. Their phrase "Simplicity is key", meaning your user should be able to navigate your page without any distractions or hindrances. They should be able to interact with your page in the way that you have designed it to meet their needs

## Back to HTML!

Now that we know what Wireframing is (or at least kind of) you can start actually piecing together your webpage and that is what you use HTML to do! HTML is used to layout your webpage and to add in the content (i.e images, wording, lists, tables, etc.). The way that you do that is through the use of what we call tags in HTML. These tags look like this `<>` and inside are the various commands that HTML recognizes in order to execute your code correctly. When you are using tags in HTML you have to open the tag and then close the tag, kind of like getting something from the fridge - first you open the door, then you grab your food, and then you close the door (can you tell how much I like food). Anyway, here's an example of code with HTML tags:

`<p> This tag is to denote a paragraph. Now the following tag will close the paragraph </p>`

Thus we have "coded" in a paragraph on our webpage in HTML.

## and finally... Semantics

The last part of this reading had to do with Semantics and, let me just say that this was just a *hair* confusing. The point of semantics though is that your code should be fairly intuitive to read. Instead of coding in a million technical lines to do one thing, try to use wha they call elements - descriptive HTML tags- to dilineate certain parts of your code and give a better description for what your code is doing.
