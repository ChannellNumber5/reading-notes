# Here's a fun topic: Looping!

These reading notes are from the following webpages:
- [Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)
- [Loops and Iterations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

So, to keep this really short, when you are coding, you may want a piece of code to do something over and over, but you don't really want to write that code over and over again, you can create a loop for that code. There are a few different loops that we tend to use in coding, but the main ones are `for` and `while` loops. A for loop is used when you know how many times you want the code to run for and a while loop is used when you want it to run until a specific condition is met.

Here is a block of code and I'll explain what it means at the bottom.

` for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { `
    `console.log(i);`
`}`

In the above block of code, I have created a for loop and, you do that by creating and giving a value to the variable i (if you don't understand that, read the notes on functions) and then you are running this code for as long as the i value is less than 10. The `i++` is standard programming notation that you will be increasing the i value each time you go through your loop. Now, for the body of the code, it is essentially displaying the number of each loop that is done and it would display 0 - 9, equalling 10 iterations.
